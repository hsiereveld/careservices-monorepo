# Care & Service Platform â€” Database Status

**Last updated:** 2025-07

## Live Data
- The Supabase database is fully populated with real, live data.
- Data includes users, professionals, bookings, services, categories, and more.

## Analytics Integration
- The `/api/admin/database-analytics` endpoint returns accurate, up-to-date analytics reflecting the current database state.
- The admin dashboard displays these live statistics, including user counts, bookings, services, and more.
- User and professional/provider lists are also populated and reflect the current state of the database.

## Developer Notes
- When working with analytics, user lists, or professional/provider lists, assume the database is populated unless otherwise noted.
- For further details, see `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` and the admin dashboard UI.
