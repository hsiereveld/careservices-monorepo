/*
  # Fix RLS policies infinite recursion

  1. Problem
    - Admin policies are causing infinite recursion by referencing user_roles table within user_roles policies
    - This creates a circular dependency when checking permissions

  2. Solution
    - Remove problematic admin policies from user_roles table
    - Simplify admin access by using service role or different approach
    - Keep user policies simple and direct

  3. Changes
    - Drop existing problematic policies on user_roles
    - Create simpler, non-recursive policies
    - Ensure admin functionality works without circular references
